Updated openFrameworks cod to work with 0.10.0

Tested with of 0.10.0 under OSX 10.12.6

Note
---------
I didn't make this addon. It was created by Alain Ramos a.k.a. ding (http://forum.openframeworks.cc/users/ding)

I dug it up in this thread: http://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/offiducialfinder/486 

Refactored the code a tiny bit and got the example sketch running.


Installation
--------
Clone/extract the addon into your openframeworks/addons folder. Ensure it is named "ofxFiducialFinder"

Create a project with the project generator and add ofxFiducialFinder and ofxOpenCv.
